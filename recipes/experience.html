            Here's a rough overview of my previous jobs and the one I currently work at.

            <strong>Rafal ehf., Reykjavík — Electrician<br></strong>
           <em>May 2021 - November 2023</em><br><br>
            Making High Voltage Terminations for the first 6 months along with substation maintenance and occasional overhead linework. Afterwards, I moved into the department of production with my mainstay being at a cabinet workshop for the creation of various panels (controls, distribution and normal house panels) with a specialization in control cabinets and sometimes working with high voltage transformers in the transformer workshop. I have lately taken on more responsibility by managing jobs at the workshop. As for the control cabinets, everything is built from the ground up. We receive a drawing which we go over, order material, and everything is built from scratch starting usually with a bottom plate, measuring everything out, fastening DIN Rails, ducts, material and making all of the necessary holes in said cabinet. The process includes quality control in which we go over the panel making sure all connections are correct and making any changes to the controls if something doesn’t make sense, whether that be adding a few terminal blocks or completely changing a certain control due to it being incorrectly drawn.

            <strong>ALCOA Fjarðaál, Reyðarfjörður — Production Operator II<br></strong>
            <em>September 2017 - September 2019</em><br><br>
            Worked in four different areas, but specialized in the operation of the HDC continuous ingot smelting machine. Fully automated system that required human supervision to ensure smooth function. Much use of HMI systems involved as well as having a deep and intricate understanding of how the machine and all its various components function. I was given the extra responsibility of seeing over absences of next shift workers and planning accordingly who should be in what position come next shift.
